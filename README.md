a tornado ioloop based irc bot framework


# iobot

This is the bones for an irc bot based on the excellent asynchronous tornado
ioloop.


The intended goal is to have an irc bot that offers a RESTful http based
gateway to the same commands as a way of unifying the irc and external
experience.  There are so many things I'd like to do from my phone or some
other script that end up getting built into the irc bot over time since it's so
convenient.
